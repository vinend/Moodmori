# Group Chat Functionality Testing

## Changes Made

1. Fixed parameter name mismatch in the API request:
   - Changed `members` to `memberIds` in the frontend request
   - Updated response handling to use `response.data.group` instead of `response.data.groupChat`

2. Improved group chat message fetching:
   - Modified `fetchGroupMessages()` to get both group details and messages separately
   - Fixed the chat user data structure to match the backend response format

3. Fixed response format in the `sendGroupMessage` backend controller:
   - Changed response format from `{ message: 'Message sent successfully', data: message }` to `{ message: messageData }`

## Testing Steps

1. **Creating a Group Chat**
   - Navigate to the chat interface
   - Click on the "Create Group" button
   - Enter a group name
   - Search and select at least 2 members
   - Click "Create Group"
   - Expected: Group chat should be created successfully and you should be taken to the group chat interface

2. **Sending Messages in Group Chat**
   - Send a message in the newly created group chat
   - Expected: Message should appear in the chat with proper styling and sender information

3. **Viewing Group Details**
   - Check if group members are displayed at the top of the chat
   - Expected: Member names should be visible

4. **Switching Between Chats**
   - Navigate between different chats including the new group chat
   - Expected: Messages should load properly for each chat

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that the backend is returning data in the expected format
3. Ensure that WebSocket connections are working properly if used
4. Confirm that user authentication is working correctly
